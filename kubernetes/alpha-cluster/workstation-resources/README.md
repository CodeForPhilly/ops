# Workstation Resources

This directory is a collection of useful (and sometimes necessary) resources
to be configured on any workstation from which administrative work on the
cluster will be performed.

## hosts

The hosts file within this directory allows access to the cluster nodes via
hostnames; these entries are absolutely necessary for deployment using the
ansible playbook, but are merely convenient for otherwise typical administration
